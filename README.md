# personal_website
This is my very first time Ideating and developing a website from scratch. This here serves as a reminder and log of the design decisions made intentionally or unintentionally during the development of my portfolio website. I believe as the years go on, frequent updates will be made to this by me and as I improve myself, the website will follow.
